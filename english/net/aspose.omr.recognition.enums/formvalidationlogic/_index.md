## FormValidationLogic enumeration

Patterns that control behavior of non-standard(error) cases during a recognition process.

```csharp
public enum FormValidationLogic
```

| Exception | `2` | Recognition engine will throw exception derived from [`OMRException`](../../aspose.omr.exceptions/omrexception). Type of exception is based on broken rule.
